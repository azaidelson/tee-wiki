# Side-channel attacks

These attacks don’t break the enclave directly, they infer secrets by watching its behavior, such as timing differences or physical emissions.

### [SGX‑Step (Interrupt‑driven single‑stepping attack)](https://github.com/jovanbulck/sgx-step)
SGX‑Step is an open‑source framework that lets an untrusted OS raise high‑frequency APIC timer interrupts, effectively single‑stepping an enclave one instruction at a time, debugger-like. By precisely measuring where each **Asynchronous Enclave Exit (AEX)** occurs, an attacker can: reconstruct fine‑grained control‑flow, defeat in‑enclave ASLR, mount data‑oriented or branch‑shadowing attacks that extract secrets such as key‑dependent branches and memory indices.

**Mitigation:**  
* Detect or rate‑limit frequent AEX events inside the enclave and abort if a threshold is exceeded.
* Adopt constant‑time, data‑oblivious code paths so that observing instruction‑level control‑flow leaks no secret‑dependent behaviour.
* Long‑term: hardware extensions such as **AEX‑Notify** let trusted enclave code run immediately after every interrupt, blocking precise single‑stepping in commodity CPUs.


### [CacheZoom (Timing-based attack)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/618.pdf)
By carefully measuring how long certain memory operations took, attackers reconstructed secret access patterns in SGX.

**Mitigation:** Developers can use constant-time algorithms and memory obfuscation techniques like ORAM to reduce timing leaks.

### Power & EM analysis
Observing power draw or electromagnetic signals during enclave execution can reveal cryptographic keys or sensitive data.

**Mitigation:** Injecting noise, isolating sensitive workloads, and rotating keys regularly can make these attacks infeasible in practice.

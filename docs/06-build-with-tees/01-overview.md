# Building with TEEs

## Open-source repositories:

* **Building with [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/)**: A lightweight, open-source Library OS designed to run unmodified Linux applications in TEEs. Gramine lifts essential OS interfaces into user space, making applications portable across platforms that implement a simple Platform Adaptation Layer (PAL).

* **Building with [DStack SDK](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack)**: The DStack SDK simplifies the steps for developers to deploy programs to a confidential VM and enables verification if an application runs inside a TEE

* **Building with [Automata SGX SDK](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-sgx-sdk)**: The Automata SGX SDK is a Rust-based toolkit that simplifies SGX application development by integrating with Rustâ€™s Cargo build system and enabling developers to design custom enclave interfaces and manage enclave memory precisely. The SDK implements the [Automata DCAP Attestation](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-dcap-attestation) workflow for verification of quotes onchain.

* **Building with [SecretVM SDK](https://github.com/automata-network/secretvm)**: The SecretVN a comprehensive platform for building, operating, verifying and securing confidential virtual machines (CVMs) using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies.

# Building with TEEs

## Open-source Repositories:

* **Building with [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/)**: A lightweight, open-source Library OS designed to run unmodified Linux applications in TEEs. Gramine lifts essential OS interfaces into user space, making applications portable across platforms that implement a simple Platform Adaptation Layer (PAL).

* **Building with [DStack SDK](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack)**: The DStack SDK simplifies the steps for developers to deploy programs to a confidential VM and enables verification if an application runs inside a TEE

* **Building with [Automata SGX SDK](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-sgx-sdk)**: The Automata SGX SDK is a Rust-based toolkit that simplifies SGX application development by integrating with Rust’s Cargo build system and enabling developers to design custom enclave interfaces and manage enclave memory precisely. The SDK implements the [Automata DCAP Attestation](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-dcap-attestation) workflow for verification of quotes onchain.
